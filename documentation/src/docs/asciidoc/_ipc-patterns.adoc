== Microservice Communication Patterns

Transactions are an essential ingredient in most enterprise applications. In the monolithic world an application typically uses a single database with ACID support for transactions. Transactions in the application that spans different services, modules and tables all share a common transactional boundary. This severely reduces complexity related to transactions. Also, frameworks like JavaEE and Spring offers a simple declarative programming model that greatly simplifies the life of developers.

Microservices consists of multiple services and each one has their own local transactional boundary. Implementing transactions for operations that updates data owned by multiple services can be complicated and we can’t make the same assumptions that we do in a monolithic world. Distributed transactions (2PC) is not a good choice for modern applications either. They are complex, technology specific and reduces performance and scaling.

The biggest obstacle many faces when adopting micro-services is moving from a mindset with a single database with ACID transactions to a multi-datastore architecture. In this chapter we’ll explore different patterns related to consistency in microservices.

=== Synchronous Calls Between Services

==== Description
Microservices exposes HTTP endpoints (REST typically) and communicate synchronously through HTTP. Each microservices has its own local datastore. Transactions are local to each microservice and there’s no coordinated commit and rollback between the services (2PC). If, for example, the shipping fails after the warehouse has been updated, you won’t find any related shipping data and the order data will probably be rolled back as well.

These types of inconsistencies can be solved through best-effort technical implementation (compensating transactions, logging, etc) and/or manual intervention (update the warehouse manually based on log data, etc). Sometimes inconsistency is tolerated, but this is domain specific.

To increase consistency the most important calls should be delayed in the orchestrator (order) as long as possible. The processing in order should also be limited after the http-calls has been done in order to reduce the number of potential errors. This is sometimes referred to as “Best effort 1-phase commit”.

==== Pros
* Fairly easy to implement and reason about (depends on consistency requirements)
* Follows a well-known programming paradigm
* Easy to system- and e2e-test (HTTP and REST)
* Easy to implement client behavior on top of order. Simple state management (either the order succeeds or it fails)

==== Cons
* 100% runtime dependency between services
* Performance of order is the sum of order + warehouse + shipping
* Doesn’t support high consistency between services
* Complex to increase consistency through means like compensating transactions, multiple transactions in order, etc

=== Asynchronous Messaging Between Services

==== Description
Microservices communicate asynchronously through messaging infrastructure. Reading, processing and delivery of messages can be performed in a highly consistent manner and be part of each microservices local transactional boundary.

There exists several architectural strategies when it comes to asynchronous messaging that has different characteristics related to reliability and consistency. Choice of messaging infrastructure technology also plays a big role and different products have different reliability guarantees. This needs to be mapped to the specific use-case and domain.

==== Pros
* High performance and scalability
* No runtime dependency between services for asynchronous messages - can submit orders if warehouse is down, etc
* High consistency and reliability between services (eventual consistency)
* Messaging infrastructure has built-in reliability guarantees

==== Cons
* More complicated flow between the services
* Rollback can be hard and compensating transactions might be needed. What happens if shipment failed after warehouse reservation has been confirmed?
* State becomes more complicated due to eventual consistency - you need to keep track of more things (order-status, etc)
* Message oriented infrastructure can become a single point of failure (depends on messaging topology)
* Testing and debugging can be challenging and technology specific
* Client behavior can become more complex - needs to poll the order status after the order has been submitted for example

=== Asynchronous Event Notification Between Services

==== Description

Microservices communicate asynchronously using event notification. When the state of a service is modified it will publish an notification event. The events are "thin" messages that are distributed between the microservices using a message broker in a publish/subscribe fashion.

In this example the events are a mix between notifications and passive/aggressive commands. This is because the source microservice expects something to happen on the basis of an event.

In a pure event notification system microservices will only publish an event that notifies other microservices that something has changed, then it’s the responsibility of the consuming microservice to call back to the source microservice synchronously to retrieve more information about the change.

==== Pros
* High performance and scalability
* High level of decoupling between the microservices
* Transactions are confined to a single microservice

==== Cons
* Higher level of complexity needed to fulfil process flow
* Process flow and system state is not explicit or obvious
* Events can lead to fuzzy side effects
* Must typically handle at-least-once delivery guarantee
* Need for a lot of correctional events in case of errors
